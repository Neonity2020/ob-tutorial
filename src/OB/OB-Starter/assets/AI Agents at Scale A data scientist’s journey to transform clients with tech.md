## AI Agents at Scale: A data scientist’s journey to transform clients with tech规模化 AI 代理：一位数据科学家的技术转型客户之旅

As a [principal data scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-sagar-jones-a67739117/) at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, I build AI solutions that solve business problems for clients. I focus on our  [Agents at Scale](https://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/mckinsey-at-vivatech-introducing-our-agents-at-scale-product-suite), a factory of AI agents working together to take on large, complex digital transformations.  
作为 QuantumBlack（麦肯锡旗下的 AI 公司）的首席数据科学家，我致力于为客户解决商业问题而构建 AI 解决方案。我专注于我们的“规模化智能体”（Agents at Scale），这是一个由 AI 智能体协同工作的工厂，共同应对大型复杂的数字化转型。

Here’s how I landed in this field, a look at the complexity of AI agents working together, and what the fast pace of change means for the future.  
以下是我如何进入这个领域，对 AI 智能体协同工作的复杂性进行探讨，以及快速变化对未来的意义。

## Why machine learning and agents spark my curiosity 为什么机器学习和智能体激发了我的好奇心

When I started my undergraduate degree in mathematics, I was convinced my future lay in finance. During my internship at an investment bank, I searched for a team that used data to predict future outcomes. To my surprise, I didn’t find what I was looking for.  
当我开始攻读数学本科学位时，我确信我的未来在金融领域。在一家投资银行的实习期间，我寻找一个使用数据预测未来结果的团队。令我惊讶的是，我没有找到我想要的。

Out of curiosity, I picked up a book on the subject during my final year at university—and I was hooked. Suddenly, I saw how data could be used to predict, simulate, and solve real-world problems and pursued a master’s degree in data science and machine learning.  
出于好奇心，在我大学最后一年，我拿起了一本关于这个主题的书——我立刻迷上了。突然，我看到了数据如何被用来预测、模拟和解决现实世界的问题，于是我追求数据科学和机器学习的硕士学位。

When I discovered QuantumBlack at a conference in London, its vision of applying advanced analytics to complex business challenges resonated with me, and I joined soon after completing my studies.  
当我在伦敦的一次会议上发现 QuantumBlack 时，它将高级分析应用于复杂商业挑战的愿景与我产生了共鸣，我在完成学业后不久就加入了。

At my core, I’m analytical. I like hard facts, numbers, and exploring all possible pathways before making a decision. Machine learning is a natural extension of that mindset—it’s about using data to understand how the world works and to tackle big problems elegantly. Over the years, my career has taken me across industries and applications, but I’ve always been drawn to challenges without obvious solutions. That curiosity eventually led me to the Agents at Scale work we’re pioneering at McKinsey.  
在我的核心，我是一个分析型的人。我喜欢硬性事实、数字，并在做决定前探索所有可能的路径。机器学习是这种思维方式的自然延伸——它关于利用数据来理解世界是如何运作的，以及优雅地解决大问题。多年来，我的职业生涯让我涉足过各个行业和应用，但我始终被没有明显解决方案的挑战所吸引。这种好奇心最终引领我来到了麦肯锡正在开创的“规模化智能体”工作。

## Building Agents at Scale 构建规模化智能体

![](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/emily%20sagar%20jones/mck-blog_emily_inline-1_1200x1200.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&cpy=Center)

When I joined the team working on what we called LegacyX, our goal was to use generative AI to modernize legacy technology. That project became the foundation for what is now Agents at Scale. It brings various agents, which are self-directed AI systems used for specific goals, together to work in teams to automate large, complex processes.  
当我加入负责我们称之为 LegacyX 的团队时，我们的目标是用生成式 AI 来现代化遗留技术。这个项目成为了现在规模化智能体的基础。它将各种智能体——这些是用于特定目标的自我导向型 AI 系统——聚集在一起，以团队形式工作来自动化大型复杂流程。

I’ve had the privilege of being part of the journey from the beginning, watching the work evolve from early experiments to the deployment of sophisticated, specialized agentic AI workforces.  
我有幸从一开始就参与其中，见证了这项工作从早期实验发展到部署复杂、专业的智能体 AI 工作队伍的过程。

One project I’m especially proud of involved modernizing a client’s legacy Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL) mainframe. Their system had been in use for more than 20 years, and very few people understood how it worked. We took on the challenge of re-architecting 15,000 lines of COBOL into under 1,000 lines of modern Java. The transformation wasn’t about line-by-line translation; it was about rethinking the entire architecture of the system. That’s where agents came in.  
我特别自豪的一个项目是帮助客户现代化其遗留的通用商业语言（COBOL）大型机系统。他们的系统已使用超过 20 年，能理解它工作原理的人非常少。我们接受了挑战，将 15,000 行 COBOL 重构为不到 1,000 行的现代 Java。这次转型并非逐行翻译；它关乎重新思考整个系统的架构。这就是智能体的用武之地。

> This work goes far beyond building technology—it’s about unlocking value for clients and their people.  
> 这项工作远不止于构建技术——它关乎为客户及其人员解锁价值。

## A factory of agents at work 正在工作的智能体工厂

I often describe this process as a digital factory floor—done by agents we’d built. On one side, agents combed through COBOL code, decoding decades of business logic. Their work was digitally handed to architect agents, who reimagined the design in modern, modular patterns, and flagged questions where human validation was needed. Coder agents then brought those designs to life in Java, producing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. At the far end of the floor, tester and fixer agents ran the new code in a sandbox, automatically detecting and correcting errors, much like a quality assurance team working continuously without breaks.  
我经常将这个过程描述为一个数字化的工厂车间——由我们构建的智能体完成。在一侧，智能体梳理着 COBOL 代码，解码数十年的业务逻辑。他们的工作被数字化地交给架构师智能体，后者以现代、模块化的模式重新构想设计，并标记出需要人类验证的问题。编码智能体随后将这些设计用 Java 实现，生成干净、高效且可维护的代码。在车间的另一端，测试和修复智能体在沙盒中运行新代码，自动检测并纠正错误，就像一个不知疲倦的质量保证团队持续工作一样。

The handoffs between these agents were seamless. Each one had a clear role, but the real power came from how they built on each other’s outputs. To make this possible, we integrated tools, enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) system, which allowed tester agents to execute, validate, and repair code autonomously. Debugging—traditionally a painstaking process—became dramatically faster and more scalable.  
这些代理之间的交接非常顺畅。每个代理都有明确的角色，但真正的力量来自于它们如何基于彼此的输出进行构建。为了实现这一点，我们集成了由模型上下文协议（MCP）系统支持的工具，这允许测试代理自主执行、验证和修复代码。调试——传统上是一个费力的过程——变得显著更快、更具可扩展性。

We achieved over 90 percent accuracy, meaning less than 10 percent of the code required human correction to achieve functional equivalency. Even more striking, the process was twice as fast as manual modernization, even though we were still building and refining the agents as we worked. And, by simply giving the agents different instructions and roles and building a slightly different factory, we can apply them to many other processes, such as identity verification.  
我们达到了超过 90%的准确率，这意味着不到 10%的代码需要人工修正才能实现功能等价。更令人惊讶的是，尽管我们在工作中仍在构建和完善代理，但该过程的速度是手动现代化的两倍。此外，只需给代理不同的指令和角色，并构建一个略有不同的工厂，我们就可以将它们应用于许多其他流程，例如身份验证。

## Bridging tech and business 连接技术与商业

![](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/emily%20sagar%20jones/mck-blog_emily_inline-2_1200x1200.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&cpy=Center)

This work goes far beyond building technology—it’s about unlocking value for clients and their people. A major part of our role is bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and industry expertise. Many clients have little prior exposure to agentic systems, so we focus on designing processes with them, validating outputs together, and helping them build the capabilities to sustain the work long after we leave.  
这项工作远不止于构建技术，它关乎为客户及其人员创造价值。我们职责的重要组成部分是弥合尖端技术与行业专业知识之间的差距。许多客户对代理系统缺乏了解，因此我们专注于与他们共同设计流程，一起验证输出结果，并帮助他们建立能够在我们离开后长期维持工作的能力。

There’s tension here with companies’ in-house coders, who want to keep coding. But their jobs as coders don’t go away—what they code will change, and a lot of tedious tasks will be automated.  
这里存在紧张关系，因为公司内部程序员希望继续编码。但他们的程序员工作并不会消失——他们编码的内容将改变，许多繁琐的任务将被自动化。

These are still early days for agentic systems. Will we evolve toward single “master agents” that can spin up specialized teams as needed? How can we improve user experience and build greater trust in these systems? And how do we ensure they remain safe, unbiased, and interoperable?  
对于代理系统来说，现在仍处于早期阶段。我们将向单一“主代理”的方向发展，这种代理可以根据需要组建专业团队吗？我们如何改善用户体验，并在这些系统中建立更大的信任？我们又如何确保它们保持安全、无偏见且可互操作？

A year ago, I was only experimenting with agents. Today, I’m deploying them with clients and helping them reimagine their operating models. The pace of change is exhilarating, and I’m optimistic about how this work will reshape how organizations function and what we can achieve together.  
一年前，我还在尝试使用智能体。如今，我正与客户一起部署智能体，帮助他们重塑运营模式。变革的速度令人兴奋，我对这项工作将如何重塑组织运作方式以及我们能共同实现的目标充满乐观。

## Four tech CEOs on leading for ‘All Seasons’

From preparing for the role to leaving a lasting legacy, every CEO faces challenges that evolve over time. In *A CEO for All Seasons*, McKinsey’s newest book on leadership, executives like Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, IBM’s Arvind Krishna, and Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen share how they navigated these stages—and how today’s leaders can sustain performance and impact.

Building on McKinsey’s 2022 bestseller *CEO Excellence*, which distilled six mindsets of the world’s best leaders, *A CEO for All Seasons* shows how the CEO role itself changes over time. It offers a hands-on guide to thriving at every stage of leadership, complete with reflection exercises McKinsey uses to counsel CEOs.

Written for aspiring senior leaders, first-time CEOs, and even board members, the book shares practical insights from more than 30 of the world’s top 200 CEOs. Below are a few highlights from the book.

### IBM’s Arvind Krishna on clear purpose informing priorities

A successful CEO tenure begins well before the appointment, with deliberate skill-building, clear reflection on motivations, and an approach grounded in humility and authenticity.

However, it also requires a clear-eyed understanding of what the job truly entails. “There’s more things to do than you have time for,” says IBM’s Arvind Krishna. “You need to wake up to the fact that you have to give up certain things in your personal life.”

That’s why only those with a clear purpose—and a commitment beyond themselves—will have the resilience to thrive at the top.

### Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen on starting strong

Stepping into the CEO role brings a shift unlike any other leadership transition. Accountability expands overnight, and instead of reporting to only one manager, the CEO answers to a board of ten or more.

“The day you’re announced CEO, your role changes drastically. Before, you had peers, and now they’re looking at you to make the call,” explains Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen.

![From left: McKinsey senior partners Vikram Malhotra, Scott Keller, Carolyn Dewar, and Kurt Strovink](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/about%20us/mckinsey%20blog/four%20tech%20ceos%20on%20leading%20for%20all%20seasons/mck-blog-ceobook-inline-2-1536x864.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&cpy=Center)

These first few years are a crucial time, requiring bold actions to set the tone, establish direction, and build credibility. With a clear, fact-based view of the business, the task then becomes identifying the few decisive moves that will truly shift performance.

As Adobe’s Narayen puts it, “You need to decide, what are the one or two things that I can do that will move the needle at the organizational level? There are fifty things that are table stakes that won’t inspire anyone. If I can talk about one or two things that can get a twinkle in your eye, I’ve done my job.”

### Netflix’s Reed Hastings on making resilience a habit

Mid-tenure can often be a tricky season due to the risk of complacency and getting stuck on the success of old strategies.

Staying ahead means staying open—constantly questioning assumptions and avoiding the comfort of past wins. Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings made resilience a habit by asking his team to imagine failure before it happened: “It’s ten years out, and Netflix is a failed firm. What are the different causes?”

“Sometimes the discussion turned to what we can do about some of these risks,” he says, “but many times, just defining what risks we faced prompted people to adjust behavior in smart ways that made us more resilient.”

### Microsoft’s Satya Nadella on leaving a stronger organization for your successor

In the final stage, the CEO’s focus shifts to continuity—ensuring the organization is left stronger than it was inherited. The best leaders see this as an institutional relay race, passing the baton to the next generation at the right time and for the right reasons.

“My dad, a civil servant in India, always used to talk about institution builders as those people whose successors do better than they did themselves. I love that definition,” Satya Nadella reflects. “If the next CEO of Microsoft can be even more successful than I am, then maybe I’ve done my job right.”

## McKinsey joins MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium as consulting advisors

Generative AI is already reshaping business, society, and our everyday lives. McKinsey research [estimates](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) the technology could generate between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually for the global economy, while increasing the impact of holistic AI use by 15 to 40 percent.

To help individuals, business, and society harness this potential, McKinsey has joined the [MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium](https://genai.mit.edu/) as a consulting advisor. The Consortium is a collaboration between industry leaders and MIT’s top thinkers founded earlier this year. The goal of the Consortium is to ensure that the transformative potential of generative AI reshapes our world in ways that create broad-based value—for businesses, individuals, and society as a whole.

“Generative AI and large language models \[LLMs\] are reshaping everything, with applications stretching across diverse sectors,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, MIT Provost, who leads the Consortium. “As we push forward with newer and more efficient models, MIT’s Generative AI Impact Consortium is committed to guiding their development and impact on the world.”

McKinsey and its AI arm, QuantumBlack, will serve as exclusive advisors to the Consortium, working with members to shape how the latest in generative AI can be applied across industries to benefit society. Our firm will contribute to professional education for Consortium members by designing and piloting “Inspire & Learn” sessions, which include generative AI learnings, use cases, visits to MIT, and hands-on exercises.

“The industry is moving quickly to harness the transformative potential of generative AI—not just to boost productivity, but to fundamentally rewire how their businesses operate,” said [Delphine Zurkiya](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/delphine-nain-zurkiya), a senior partner at McKinsey. “McKinsey research [shows](https://www.mckinsey.com/cn/our-insights/our-insights/beyond-the-hype-unlocking-value-from-the-ai-revolution) nearly 80 percent of organizations are now using generative AI—but most still need to unlock its impact at scale to benefit their stakeholders. By being part of the MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium, McKinsey aims to help shape the next wave of innovation and ensure generative AI delivers lasting impact and true productivity gains for both business and society,” she said.

At the core of the Consortium’s mission is collaboration, and McKinsey joins founding members Analog Devices, The Coca-Cola Co., OpenAI, Tata Group, SK Telecom, and TWG Global.

With AI poised to disrupt industries and create new opportunities, this collaboration—and diversity of perspectives—will be critical to ensure that change benefits both businesses and society, whether that’s preparing the workforce for the future of work, accelerating generative AI’s adoption across all users and geographies, or ensuring thoughtful safety and ethical guardrails are in place for different use cases.

“With its deep technical expertise and industry insights around generative AI, McKinsey will be an important advisor in shaping our research priorities and enterprise technology roadmaps, as well as supporting our continued professional education efforts,” says Vivek Farias, a professor at the MIT Sloan School. “Ultimately, our Consortium will measure its success by how well its work creates value for businesses and research alike, helps people, and fulfills the promise of AI for generations to come.”

This collaboration aligns with McKinsey’s broader commitment to helping shape a future where generative AI drives inclusive economic growth, supports workforce evolution, and fosters sustainable innovation on a global scale.
